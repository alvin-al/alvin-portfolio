# Alvin Al Portfolio

Welcome to my personal website, where I showcase my projects and share a bit about myself. This website is built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and React.

## About Me

I'm Alvin Al, currently pursuing a degree in Information Systems at Open University of Indonesia. With a background in Farm Administration and graphic design, I've developed a diverse skill set that combines both creative and technical expertise.

Driven by my passion for problem-solving and creativity, I spend much of my time in front of the computer crafting something. Currently, I'm focusing on frontend development, with plans to transition into React Native or full-stack development in the future.

I have a particular fondness for styling web applications using Tailwind CSS because I work as graphic designer before. I believe in the power of minimalist and simple design, employing a straightforward approach to create elegant and user-friendly interfaces.

I'm dedicated to continuous learning and improvement, always seeking out opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills in the field of software engineering.
